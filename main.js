I know, it’s kinda obvious, but if you’re like me it can be hard sometimes. I like to choke the chicken the same way I like to sleep: on the bed, eyes closed, masturbating furiously to the idea of titties and traps galore.\n2: No lube, no mercy; the way life ought to be.\n3: Even so, it’s hard to enjoy such voluptuous things when a lifetime of failure and regret is trying to block the view.\n4: What’s a man to do? Little Richard’s still up and ready, the giz rag’s good to go, yet here I am looking back at the uninterrupted stream of missed opportunities, squandered resources, and easily-avoided catastrophes that I have made my life into. The wank’s been ruined, I feel more alone than ever, but the worst part is that I still need to bust a nut!\n5: Then, a moment of brilliance! I can jerk off to one of the gals that took part in my personal, unending comedy of errors! Maybe I could go for that gal who genuinely enjoyed my company until I got too… aggressive… in trying to bust out of the friend zone. Boy golly that’s still a painful memory! Like, physically painful. This would probably be easier if I was a masochist, but a man has to make do with the hand he’s got from day to day.\n6: Mayhaps one of my old teachers would work better, like that Jewish bird who watched me do the Hitler salute during the pledge of allegance. Nah, she’s a cunt with a face made of botox and the imitation of a human soul. Besides, I don’t regret doing that anyway.\n7: Maybe I could just get my mind off the whole buissness anyway. You know, write a lil story or something, make a few people laugh, then get back down to buissness. Yeah, that sounds about right.")
